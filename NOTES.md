This was way easier than I thought it was going to be! Maybe Facebook is good for something after all.

There are a few things I still need to do:
1. Write the functionality for the mode-selector switch.
2. Make something happen when you tap the question mark.
3. Make the winning screen look nicer.
4. Figure out an algorithm for finding the "pars".

Upshot:
-Mode-selector works
-Question mark doesn't work yet - modals are tricky
-Winning screen looks the same - w/e
-Pars is well underway

I've been thinking it would be a good idea to be able to show the binary pattern for the goal number. I was thinking of making a tiny component and putting it in a tooltip or popover, but now I'm thinking it would be better to just have the byte button array change when you mouse over the goal button. Let's get to it!

Actually I'm not going to do that right now. As a matter of fact, I think I'd better give this project a rest for a little while. I might just deploy it as is.

A few changes I would like to make at some point:
-Implement keypad buttons as a map function.
-Add the above-mentioned mouseover effect
-Just clean up and organize everything
-Make the win screen look nicer.

This was way easier than I thought it was going to be! Maybe Facebook is good for something after all.

There are a few things I still need to do:
1. Write the functionality for the mode-selector switch.
2. Make something happen when you tap the question mark.
3. Make the winning screen look nicer.
4. Figure out an algorithm for finding the "pars".
